# Educational Chatbot: Evolution and Implementation

This project explores the journey of chatbots in education, from basic rule-based systems to advanced models. The aim is to develop a specialized chatbot tailored for children, focusing on data science education.

## Objectives

- Develop an interactive learning environment for children.
- Implement adaptive algorithms for personalized education.
- Enhance semantic understanding and context awareness.
- Incorporate multimodal learning experiences.
- Deploy the chatbot using Flask for accessibility.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Intent Data Collection**: Collected intent data was organized into a JSON file named `intents.json`, containing user patterns, tags, and predefined responses.
  
- **Tokenization and Lemmatization**: Utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for tokenizing sentences and lemmatizing words, standardizing the vocabulary for training.
  
- **Building Training Data**: Converted user patterns into a bag-of-words representation, where each sentence was tokenized, lemmatized, and transformed into a binary array representing the presence or absence of words.
  
- **Shuffling and Splitting**: Shuffled training data to mitigate biases and then divided it into features (input) and labels (output) for training the model.

### Model Architecture

- **Neural Network Design**: Implemented a Sequential model using the TensorFlow Keras API, comprising Dense layers for learning associations between words and intents. Dropout layers were included to prevent overfitting.
  
- **Input and Output Layers**: Configured the input layer to accommodate the vocabulary length and the output layer to employ the softmax activation function for predicting intent probabilities based on the bag-of-words representation of user input.

### Training

- **Feature-Label Pairing**: Organized training data into feature-label pairs, where features represent the bag-of-words representation of user input, and labels correspond to intent categories.
  
- **Epochs and Batch Size**: Trained the model for 100 epochs with a batch size of 5, allowing iterative adjustments of weights and biases to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss.

### Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics, measuring its ability to correctly predict intents on a validation set. Visualized the accuracy over epochs using Matplotlib.

## Results and Discussion

The trained model demonstrates a foundational understanding of user input and intents, laying the groundwork for educational applications.

## Future Work

Opportunities for further development include adaptive learning algorithms, semantic understanding, multimodal learning experiences, gamification, and collaborative learning environments.
