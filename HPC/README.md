   - Categorical cross-entropy is employed as the loss function for multi-class classification.
   - Metrics such as accuracy are monitored during training.
3. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset, split into training and validation sets.
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
   - One-hot encode class labels for both training and validation sets.
4. **Training Loop:**
   - Train the model using the fit method, iterating through batches of the training dataset.
   - The training process occurs over five epochs, with performance monitoring.
   - Validation data is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data during training.
   - Training and validation loss, as well as accuracy, are displayed after each epoch.
